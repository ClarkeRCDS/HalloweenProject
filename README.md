# HalloweenProject

Write a Repl.it program to simulate Trick Or Treating on Halloween.  Create at least two classes including a class for Person and a class for House.  Be creative in your design of attributes and methods for each class.  There should be a treat() method, and a trick() method*, as well as other getters and setters.  There will be obvious attributes including name, costume, address, piecesOfCandy, typeOfCandy, numHousesVisited, and houseIsDecorated.  You should add other original attributes to make your Trick Or Treating simulation unique.  

Create Person and House classes.  Be sure to include attributes and behaviors for each of your classes.  Every object created from Person and House must be different.
You should write a tester to print out a simulated trick or treating experience for at least four trick or treaters.  At least four houses must be visited by each trick or treater, including both decorated and undecorated houses.  In the event a house is decorated, the trick or treater will get candy, otherwise, the trick or treater will play a trick at the house.  
Test and make sure your simulation works. ( You will need a main class to run the entire program.)



A simple (minimum) printout for a trick or treater may look like this.

Mr. Leath was dressed as Mario, visited 6 houses, collected 42 pieces of candy, played the trick of placing glowing eyes in a shrub 2 times, and was home by 7:30pm. 7 Alexander Court gave out Mr. Leathâ€™s favorite candy, gummy worms.
